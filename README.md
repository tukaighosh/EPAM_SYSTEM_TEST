# EPAM_SYSTEM_TEST

1. Firstly, build all the services
	I've given build.cmd for all the services
2. start all the services by java -jar command or from any preferred IDE
	Please start the eureka service first, then all other services.
3. Swagger API is provided for easily testing without POSTMAN or any other rest client

note : I've used lombok in the project to avoid writting few boiler-plate codes, thus your IDE should have lombok plugin installed.
